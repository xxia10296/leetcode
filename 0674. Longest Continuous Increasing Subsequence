Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).

Example 1:
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 

var findLengthOfLCIS = function(nums) {
    let len = 1;
    let longest = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i+1] > nums[i]) {
            len++;
        } else {
            len = 1;
        };
        longest = Math.max(longest, len);
    };
    return longest;
};
