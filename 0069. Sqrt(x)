Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
             
var mySqrt = function(x) {
    if (x <=1) {return x}
    let lo = 1, hi = x/2;
    while (lo <= hi) {
        let mid = lo + Math.floor((hi-lo)/2);
        if (mid * mid > x) {
            hi = mid -1;
        } else {
            lo = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return lo-1;
};
