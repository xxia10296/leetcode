Given a rectangular cake with height h and width w, and two arrays of integers horizontalCuts and verticalCuts where horizontalCuts[i] is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut and similarly, verticalCuts[j] is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the jth vertical cut.

Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays horizontalCuts and verticalCuts. Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.

var maxArea = function(h, w, horizontalCuts, verticalCuts) {
    horizontalCuts.push(h);
    verticalCuts.push(w);
    horizontalCuts.sort((a, b) => a-b);
    verticalCuts.sort((a, b) => a-b);
    let maxH = -Infinity;
    let maxW = -Infinity;
    
    let headH = 0;
    for (let h of horizontalCuts) {
        maxH = Math.max(maxH, h-headH);
        headH = h;
    }
    
    let headW = 0;
    for (let w of verticalCuts) {
        maxW = Math.max(maxW, w-headW);
        headW = w;
    }
    
    let maxArea = maxH * maxW % (10**9 + 7);
    return maxArea; 
};
