Given a sorted array A of unique numbers, find the K-th missing number starting from the leftmost number of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [4,7,9,10], K = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The first missing number is 5.
Example 2:

Input: A = [4,7,9,10], K = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: 
The missing numbers are [5,6,8,...], hence the third missing number is 8.

var missingElement = function(nums, k) {
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let diff = nums[i+1]-nums[i]-1;
        if (k <= diff) return nums[i]+k;
        if (k>diff) k -= diff;
    }
    return nums[nums.length-1] + k;
};
