Given an array nums sorted in ascending order, return true if and only if you can split it into 1 or more subsequences such that each subsequence consists of consecutive integers and has length at least 3.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5

var isPossible = function(nums) {
    let freq = {};
    let need = {};
    for (let num of nums) {
        freq[num] = (freq[num] || 0) +1;
    };
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (freq[num] === 0) continue;
        freq[num]--;
        if (need[num] > 0) {
            need[num]--;
            need[num+1] = (need[num+1]||0) +1;
        } else if (freq[num+1]>0 && freq[num+2]>0) {
            freq[num+1]--;
            freq[num+2]--;
            need[num+3] = (need[num+3] || 0) +1;
        } else return false;
    };
    return true;
};
