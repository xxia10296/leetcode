Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.
Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]

var reconstructQueue = function(people) {
    // O(nlogn+n**2)
    people.sort((a, b) => b[0]-a[0] || (a[0]===b[0] && a[1]-b[1]))
    let res = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
        res.splice(people[i][1], 0, people[i]);        
    };
    return res;
};
