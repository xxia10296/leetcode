Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
Example 1:

Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.

var hammingWeight = function(n) {
    let res = 0;
    while (n !== 0) {
        res++;
        n &= (n-1);   // this can flip the right-most 1 to a 0
    };
    return res;
};
