Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
Example 2:

Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: head = [1]
Output: 1
Example 4:

Input: head = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 18880

var getDecimalValue = function(head) {
    let output = 0;
    let node = head;
    while (node) {
        //output = output << 1 | node.val;
        output = 2 * output + node.val;
        node = node.next
    }
    return output;
};
